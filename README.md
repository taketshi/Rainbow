# Rainbow
## Motivation
Cryptography course project

## Description
Multivariate public key cryptography is one of the main approaches to guarantee the security of communication in a post-quantum world. In this report we will study one of the most promising candidates in the area, the Rainbow signature scheme, Ô¨Årst introduced by J. Ding and D. Schmidt in 2005.

## Build Status
Completed

## Files
- rainbow: folder containing the rainbow signature scheme implementation
- _main.py_: python file running a test of the rainbow implementation
- announcements: Folder with Data/Verification base that allows you to write announcements as an user, generating a signature for it. It also allows you to verify if a certain announcement was made by a certain user by using its public key and comparing it to the announcement.
Note: Use only lower case letters and space.

## Packages
- pyfinite
- random
